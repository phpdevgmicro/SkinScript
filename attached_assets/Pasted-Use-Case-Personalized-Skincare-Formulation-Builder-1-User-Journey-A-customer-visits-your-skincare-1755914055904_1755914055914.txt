Use Case: Personalized Skincare Formulation Builder
1. User Journey

A customer visits your skincare web app.

They see the interactive ingredient selection form (like your mockup).

They check boxes for their skin type, preferred format, and ingredients.

Example selection:

Skin type → Oily

Format → Mist

Key actives → Caffeine

Functional Extracts → Beta Vulgaris (Beet), Avena Sativa

Boosters → none

They enter contact info (email/phone).

They click Submit Request.

2. Backend Functionality

When submitted:

The system logs the entry in a database (MySQL / Firebase).

It also sends you an email summary:

New User Request:
- Skin Type: Oily
- Format: Mist
- Actives: Caffeine
- Extracts: Beet, Avena Sativa
- Boosters: None
- Contact: user@example.com

3. Smart Formulation Logic

The system runs pre-coded rules (or AI-based logic):

Rule Example:

If caffeine + beetroot + oat → suggest energizing + anti-fatigue + calming profile.

If caffeine + bilberry + neem → target oily/acne-prone skin.

Auto-generate a suggested formulation:

Caffeine: 0.3%

Beta Vulgaris Extract: 2%

Avena Sativa Extract: 1.5%

Hydrating Base (mist): 96.2%

Preservative: 0.5%

4. PDF Preview (Auto-generated)

A PDF file is generated with:

Title: “Your Energizing Mist – Oily Skin Formula”

Ingredient Breakdown (% w/w)

Description:
“A lightweight mist designed for oily skin. Caffeine helps energize and depuff, beetroot extract boosts radiance, while oat extract soothes irritation.”

The PDF is emailed to the user, and optionally available for instant download.

5. Optional AI-Powered Add-on

If you integrate GPT API:

The AI could generate marketing copy, safety notes, or alternative suggestions.

Example:
“Since you chose caffeine and beetroot, we recommend avoiding retinol in the same formula due to sensitivity concerns. Would you like to swap it with Niacinamide?”
